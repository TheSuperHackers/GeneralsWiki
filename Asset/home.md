## **Overview**

Welcome to the **Generals: Zero Hour Asset Patch** repository! This project focuses on improving and enhancing the
in-game assets of *Command & Conquer: Generals - Zero Hour*, including textures, sound files, models, GUI elements,
localization, and more. This differs from the **GeneralsGameCode** project, which focuses on the game’s source code. The
goal of this project is to provide a higher quality and more polished experience for players through asset improvements.

## **Getting Started**

To get started with the project, you can submit issues or pull requests (PRs). Additionally, you can install the current
asset patch using **GeneralsModBuilder** (see the [installation guide](Patch/Installation_Instructions.md)),
which allows you to install the patch directly into your game directory and try it out.
