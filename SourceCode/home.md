## **Overview**

Welcome to the **Generals: Zero Hour Game Code** repository! This project is dedicated to the game’s source code, which
enables contributors to work on improvements, fixes, and new features. The **Generals: Zero Hour - Asset Patch** project
focuses on improving the game's assets (textures, localizations, models), whereas this project centers on the underlying
game mechanics and the technical aspects of *Command & Conquer: Generals - Zero Hour*. If you're interested in coding,
modifying, or extending the game’s core functionality, you're in the right place!

## **Getting Started**

To get started with the project, you will need a basic understanding of the source code and how to build it. If you're
new to the project, here’s how you can contribute:

- Check out the [**Build Guides**](Build_Guides.md) for instructions on how to compile the game code on
  different platforms.
- Learn about the project's **dependencies** and **libraries** in the [Dependencies](Dependencies.md) section.
- Look through the **community forks** and other variations of the project in the [Forks](Forks.md) section.
- If you're an experienced developer, you can start contributing by reviewing and submitting **pull requests** or
  opening **issues**.

These guides will help you get set up and running, so you can start working on the game code in no time.

## **Dependencies & Libraries**

This section outlines all the essential dependencies and libraries you need in order to successfully build and run the
source code. It includes:

- **External Libraries**: Instructions on downloading and configuring the third-party libraries required by the project.
- **Codebase Structure**: Understanding the layout and architecture of the game code.

## **Tools for Developers**

As a developer, you will need a set of tools to interact with the codebase efficiently. Here are some tools that can
assist you:

- **Code Editors/IDEs**: Recommended editors/IDEs for working with the game’s code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc.).
- **Debugging Tools**: Recommended tools for debugging and troubleshooting.
- **Version Control**: Using Git for managing changes, commits, and collaboration.

Check out the [**Tools for Developers**](Tools.md) page for more information.

## **Community and Forks**

The **Generals: Zero Hour Game Code** project has several community-driven forks. These forks often implement
experimental features or enhancements, and it’s a great place to explore different approaches to the game code. You can
also contribute to these forks or integrate them into the main codebase.
