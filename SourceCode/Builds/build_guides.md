# Build Guides

This page provides an overview of the official and community-supported build guides for **TheSuperHackers** project. It
includes both the official build guides for the main repository and guides for community forks of the project. The
guides cover different environments, configurations, and setups for building the project.

## Build Configurations Overview

Before diving into the build guides, it's important to understand the different build configurations used in the
project. These configurations dictate how the project is built, whether for debugging, profiling, release, or internal
development purposes. Some common configurations include:

- **Release:** Optimized for end-users, providing a smaller, faster executable with no debugging information.
- **Debug:** Includes debugging information, making it easier to trace and debug the code, but without optimization to
  ensure ease of debugging.
- **Internal:** Includes debugging information and optimizations, used primarily by developers for testing and internal
  purposes.
- **Profile:** Used for performance profiling, with optimizations enabled and additional debugging options to collect
  profiling data.

Each configuration is designed for a different purpose, whether you're building for development, debugging, testing, or
releasing the final product. You can find more details about the build configurations in
the [Build Configurations](build_configuration) page.

## Architectures and Toolchains

The project supports multiple architectures and toolchains, which is why there are various build guides tailored to
different environments. An **architecture** refers to the target platform, such as **x86** (32-bit) or **x64** (64-bit),
while a **toolchain** is the set of tools (compilers, linkers, etc.) used to build the project. Different toolchains may
support different optimizations, libraries, or debugging features that influence how the build process is conducted.

## Community Forks Build Guides

These are the guides provided for community-supported forks of **TheSuperHackers** project. These forks are customized
versions of the original repository and may have unique build setups.

1. **MSVC22 (x64) Generals Only (Windows)**
    - A guide for building a custom fork of the project using MSVC 2022 (x64) for Windows, specifically tailored for
      the "Generals Only" version.
