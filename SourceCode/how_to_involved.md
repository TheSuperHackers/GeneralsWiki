# **How to Contribute to the Code Repository as CPP Developer**

Welcome to the **Generals Zero Hour** code repository! If you're interested in contributing to the development of the
game engine, there are several areas where you can help improve the code, add new features, or fix bugs. Whether you
specialize in game development, tools, or platform compatibility, your contributions are highly valued!

#### Contributing for Non-CPP Developers
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

You don't need to be a C++ developer to contribute! Here are some ways you can help:

- **Documentation**  
  Improve or create documentation to make the project more accessible. Clear guides and explanations are always needed!

- **Game Assets and Localization**  
  If you're an artist or designer, you can contribute by creating or improving game assets such as textures, models,
  animations, and other visual elements. Additionally, you can help by translating the game into other languages or
  improve AI scripts to enhance gameplay.

Your contributions in these areas are just as valuable in improving the overall project!

### **1. Building and Compilation**

At the moment, there isn't a stable and organized build system in TheSuperHackers repository. If you have experience
with build systems, this is an area where your help is needed. Improving and stabilizing the build process will help
future contributors get started more easily. Contributions may include setting up tools like CMake or enhancing
integration with IDEs such as Visual Studio.

### **2. Bug Fixes in the Code**

There are many bugs within the game’s core engine that need attention. Whether it's fixing crashes, resolving memory
leaks, or improving game performance, your expertise can help make a significant difference. Bugs are tracked within the
repository, and contributions to their resolution are highly appreciated.

### **3. Adding New Features**

The game engine is constantly evolving, and there are many opportunities to add new features to improve the player
experience. This could include enhancing AI, introducing new game mechanics, or adding customizable modules to expand
gameplay options. If you have ideas for new features, we encourage you to contribute your code and help bring them to
life.

### **4. Memory Management and Optimization**

Memory management is crucial to the game’s performance. Many areas of the game’s codebase could be optimized to improve
memory handling, reduce CPU and GPU load, and ensure smoother gameplay across different hardware. This includes:

- Fixing memory leaks
- Optimizing resource allocation
- Improving performance for large-scale maps and complex game logic

### **5. Tools Development and Enhancement**

Several tools are available to help modders and developers work with the game, and there’s plenty of room for
improvement. For example:

- **GUIEdit:** This tool allows editing of `wnd` files that define the user interface layout. It has a released version
  called **WNDEdit**, but there are still improvements and bug fixes that can be applied.
- **WorldBuilder:** This tool is used by map creators and has a list of bugs and features that could be enhanced.
- **FinalBIG:** A tool used for managing the game’s archive files (BIG files). Enhancing or fixing bugs in FinalBIG will
  help make modding easier for the community.

The open-source code for these tools is available in the repository, and contributions to these projects are welcome.

### **6. Cross-Platform Compatibility**

Many players use Linux and Mac systems to play **Generals Zero Hour**, and ensuring cross-platform compatibility is
important. If you have experience with porting games to different operating systems, your help in making the game run
smoothly on platforms such as Linux and MacOS would be extremely valuable. Contributions may include adapting code,
ensuring compatibility with open-source libraries, or fixing platform-specific issues.

### **7. Replacing Outdated or Closed-Source Dependencies**

As **Generals Zero Hour** continues to evolve, there may be dependencies in the code that are either outdated or
closed-source. Replacing these with open-source alternatives can improve the game’s maintainability and compatibility
with modern systems. If you have experience with finding or implementing open-source replacements for deprecated
libraries or closed-source tools, your contributions in this area would be highly valuable.

---

There are many ways to contribute to the **Generals Zero Hour** project, whether it's through improving the game’s core
engine, enhancing the tools used by the community, or ensuring cross-platform compatibility. Your contributions will
help us improve the game and make it more accessible to players and developers alike.
